2. Ask for the user's name using `prompt`. Print the message 'Your name is %name%' using `alert`.

3. Ask the user for a number. Print the square of this number with `alert`.

4. Create three variables - hour, minute, second. Use them to output the current time in the format 'hour:minute:second'.

5. Using the ternary operator, write code that asks "What is the 'official' name of JavaScript?".  If the visitor enters "ECMAScript", output "Correct!", if something else, output "Don't know? "ECMAScript!".

6. The variable `month` contains some number from the interval from 1 to 12. Determine in which season this month falls (winter, summer, spring, fall).

7. The variable `min` contains a number from 0 to 59. Determine in which quarter of an hour this number falls (first, second, third or fourth).

8. Write code that asks for a login (`prompt`). If the visitor enters "Admin", it will ask for the password, if he/she clickscancel (escape) - output "Login canceled", if he/she enters something else - "I don't know you". Check the password like this. If the password "Black Master" is entered, then output "Welcome!", otherwise - "Password is incorrect", if you cancel - "Entrycanceled".
